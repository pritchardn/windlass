# Explanation 
Here we are trying to run examples written by others. Hopefully leading towards an Astronomy-style example for use in 
final publications.

- `simple_01_basic.graph` fails since the sleepApp class does not exist
- `simple_01_basic2.graph` succeeds because this is changed to dlg.apps.simple.SleepApp
  -  Moral of the story: There needs better documentation around
    - What apps are available
    - What their arguments are
    - This needs to be accessible to someone who has done a pip install
