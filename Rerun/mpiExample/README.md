# MPI Example

The goal here is to:
1. Get MPI working with DALiuGE in some form
2. Consider a variety of possible example graphs demonstrating Rerunning

## TODO:
- Monte-Carlo PI in Python - Raw Drops
  - Writing to file 
- Monte-Carlo PI in C  - Raw Drops
  - Writing to file
- Monte-Carlo PI in Python - Graph
- Monte-Carlo PI in C - Graph
- Rerun experiments
  - Changing rank - Success
  - Changing method - Failure
- Repeat experiments
  - Changing rank - Failure
  - Changing code - Failure
    - Interesting since inspection into codefiles is not possible...
- Reproduce experiments
  - Differing methods (Python/C), identicle results 
  
## Done
